The game starts in an overhead view of a gray maze, but a tap of the ‘Tab’ key swaps the view to first-person (this first maze can be completed in either perspective). There is also an easter egg feature (pressing ‘C’) that allows the user to make the walls of the maze invisible to add challenge for the user. In this mode, the user is able to see their trail, but cannot see the walls of the maze.

The player can jump against the direction of gravity by pressing the spacebar. Holding the spacebar jumps higher. The player can move perpendicular to the direction of gravity using the ‘WASD’ or arrow keys, as you would expect. Shift and Control sprint and crouch respectively, which increase and decrease your speed respectively.

The player can move the mouse (“mouselook”) over different parts of the play screen to rotate and see other angles on the world.   

The user can click ‘f’ to cycle between white flashlight, blue flashlight, and no flashlight.

Try to find the floating, rotating shapes! They are the goals.
